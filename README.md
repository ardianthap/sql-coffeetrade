This project aims to explore the data obtained and find out several key insights on the market situation.

- **Identify Top Contributors in Coffee Trade:** Analyze and identify top contributing countries in terms of export and import volumes and values, providing a clear understanding of global coffee trade dynamics.
- **Calculation and Insight Extraction:** Create advanced calculation queries to derive meaningful insights, such as average trade values, growth rates, and relative profitability, to inform strategic business decisions.
- **Assess Export Profitability:** Determine which countries profit the most from their exports, enabling businesses to benchmark performance and identify lucrative markets.
- **Highlight Generous Import Spending:** Recognize countries that spend generously on imports, offering insights into market demand and potential business opportunities for exporters.
- **Assess Countries Trade Growth:** Analyze the trading data calculated previously, which country has promising growth and and cross-check if it aligns with their stability metric.

  In the process of query development, some queries were changed or created in an ad-hoc basis, for example, there were column names changes and an attempt of creating a duplicate table for backup.
  Hopefully the documentation provided is well written and readable enough for anyone to check out.

  Though it was not strictly sequential, I recommend to observe the query files in the order below:
  1. table creation
  2. sorting and finding
  3. calculation
